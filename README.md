>ðŸ“Œ Despite having achieved remarkable success in the ABSA task, deep neural networks are prone to learning ***spurious correlations*** between input features and output labels, leading to poor robustness and generalization capability.

In this paper, we propose a novel Counterfactual-Enhanced Information Bottleneck framework (called **CEIB**) to mitigate the spurious correlation problem for ABSA. Concretely, **(1)** we employed the information bottleneck (IB) principle to discard superfluous information and shallow patterns while preserving sufficient information about the sentiment labels; **(2)** extended the original IB to a factual-counterfactual balancing setting to learn more robust and balanced representations against the dataset bias; **(3)** devised a multi-pattern prompting method and leveraged LLM to automatically generate counterfactual samples with promising quality.
